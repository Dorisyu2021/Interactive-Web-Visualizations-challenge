# Interactive-Web-Visualizations-challenge

Please find my code in startercode folder=>static=>js=>app.js, the index.html will show you the website as well after go live. This is the website just in case: http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html I also added some screenshots for this page
I followed the steps to build my github page, but it didn't show as the moment I submit my homework. Please let me know it works or not.
I didn't figure out all code for the bonus portion, but at least part of it is already there. I may update it later.
Thank you
